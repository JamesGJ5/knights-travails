Fun object-oriented project that involves using a breadth-first traversal to find the shortest path a knight can take between two squares on a chessboard. Sadly, it lacks a frontend.

See ./src/modules/board.js for the algorithm used.

If you'd like to use the algorithm, clone this GitHub repo, amend the start and end coordinates in the console.log statement in ./src/index.js accordingly and run the file using node.

Note: theoretical board has integer i-coordinates in the range [0, 7] and integer j-coordinates in the range [0, 7], too.
